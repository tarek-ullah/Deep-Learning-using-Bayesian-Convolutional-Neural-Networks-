# Deep-Learning-using-Deterministic-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-
Implementation of Deep learning using Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks in Keras in frontend and Tensorflow / Theano  as  backend. This repo was created for directly pulling the model from AWS/Floydhub and it's not an original work.
